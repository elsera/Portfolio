## About me
Hello. My name is Elvira. I have been passionate about IT since university. I have worked as a account manager, technical support engineer, and as a statistical programmer in clinical research. Now I'm trying myself in the field of testing. My participation in this project gave me a lot, it was a great chance to improve my abilities in testing, programming, as well as a good personal challenge. 
  In this portfolio, I would like to share my knowledge and work received during this challenge.
